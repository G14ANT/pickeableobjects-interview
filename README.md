# pickeableobjects-interview
A little game created for a technical interview. It consists of creating a simple environment where a "playercontroller" must interact with the objects. In this case, just grabbing it and dropping it with physics.

### First of all, we appear in the sandbox. We can move with the "asdw" keys. Everything is controlled by the "playercontroller".

### The box has a "collider" and interaction with the "playercontroller". In this case, it will be held in a position relative to the arms.

### The box has a "collider" and interaction with the "playercontroller". In order to grab the box, we must press the "e" key. In this case, it will remain in the position that appears in the photo. You can walk and the box will not fall or deform (pickup system)

### You can drop the item again pressing "e" key. It will fall only by the "force of gravity" without adding any extra force to it.
